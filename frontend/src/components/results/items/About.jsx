      To win, candidates must receive more than 50 percent of the vote. If no
      candidate reaches that threshold, the top two candidates will advance to a
      run off on April 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percentages are based on the available ballots tallied by the Chicago
      Board of Elections. Percentages listed do not indicate a winner until all
      ballots are counted.
