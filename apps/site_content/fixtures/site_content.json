If you are registered already, it will also give you your polling place location and absentee ballot options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not already registered, <a href=\"https://chicagoelections.com/en/register-to-vote-change-of-address.html\">you can register online</a>, via snail-mail, in-person at Early Voting, on Election Day, or at the Secretary of State&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are registering in person, you must present two forms of ID, one of which must show your current address. Chicago voters may use any of the dozens of Early Voting locations in the city:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>At the Loop Super Site from Jan. 30 - Feb. 25; and</li>\r\n\t<li>At the 50 ward sites from Feb. 11 - Feb. 25.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Can I register to vote on Election Day? </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Election Day registration is also available on Feb. 26th, but only at the polling place assigned to your home precinct. (Just to be safe, we recommend registering in advance!)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Where do I vote (how to find your &ldquo;polling place&rdquo;)?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://chicagoelections.com/en/your-voter-information.html\">Enter your address here</a>, and it will tell you where to vote. Remember, your vote won&#39;t count if you vote in the wrong ward. If you&#39;ve moved since the last election, make sure you <a href=\"https://chicagoelections.com/en/register-to-vote-change-of-address.html\">update your registration</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What time are the polls open in Chicago on Election Day?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Feb. 26th.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Can I vote early?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. There are two windows of in-person early voting starting Jan. 28, described below. Remember: A government-issued photo ID is not required but is helpful if there is a question about your registration, address or signature, or if there are two voters with the same or similar names at the same address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Registration services are available at every Early Voting site, and any voter who needs to register for the first time, or file an address update or a name change must show two forms of ID, one of which shows the voter&#39;s current address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That ballot you cast in Early Voting is final.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In-person Early Voting, 1st Window: For all registered voters, in-person Early Voting is available Jan. 28 - February 11, at the Loop Super Site, 175 W.

The deadline for requesting a ballot is 5 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 21. You can find more information at the <a href=\"https://chicagoelections.com/en/vote-by-mail.html\">Chicago elections website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Can I vote online or via social media?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No. Sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What&#39;s a runoff election?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to win an elected position in the 2019 Municipal Elections, a candidate must receive a majority, or more than 50 percent of the votes. If no candidate wins on February 26th in a race, the top two candidates in the race will compete in a runoff election on April 2, 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Who should I vote for?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>That is, of course, entirely up to you.
